The solution to this kind of error is often multifaceted and involves systematic troubleshooting:

1. **Clean Installation:**  Start by removing the `node_modules` folder (`rm -rf node_modules`) and reinstalling all your project dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This ensures you're working with clean, updated packages.

2. **Check Package Versions:** Carefully review your `package.json` for any potentially conflicting dependency versions, especially those related to React Native, Expo, and any native modules you're using. Consider using a tool like `npm-check-updates` to check for outdated packages and update them to their latest compatible versions.

3. **Clear Caches:** Expo uses a cache system that can sometimes become corrupted.  Try clearing the cache using `expo prebuild` and then restarting `expo start` with the `--clear` flag (`expo start --clear`).  Additionally, clearing the npm or yarn cache may be beneficial.

4. **Examine Native Modules (If Applicable):** If your project includes native modules (for example, `react-native-camera`, `react-native-maps`), these can be major sources of seemingly unrelated bundling errors. Ensure these are correctly installed, linked (if necessary), and configured for your development environment and target platform (Android or iOS).

5. **Restart your computer:** Sometimes a simple restart will help to reset the processes and resolve the error.

6. **Check Network Connectivity:** Make sure you have a stable internet connection.  Expo relies on network resources during the build process. Check proxy settings and firewall rules to ensure they're not interfering.

7. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:**  If the issue persists, create a small, isolated project that demonstrates the error. This will greatly help in isolating the problem's source and getting assistance from others. If possible try updating expo and the expo cli as well.
