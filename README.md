# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors During `expo start`

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose, problem encountered when using Expo's `expo start` command. The errors are usually vague and don't directly pinpoint the root cause.  This can be frustrating for developers.

The error might manifest as seemingly random crashes or obscure messages from the Metro bundler.

This repo includes example code demonstrating a scenario that can lead to such problems, as well as a solution to resolve the error.

## Reproducing the Problem

(Instructions to reproduce the problem would go here, perhaps involving a specific setup of dependencies or a particular code snippet.  This would depend on the actual scenario causing the unexpected behavior.)

## Solution

The solution often involves a combination of approaches:

1. **Dependency Review:** Carefully examine `package.json` for dependency conflicts. Use tools to check for version compatibility.  Try `npm ls` or `yarn why <package-name>` to analyze dependency trees.
2. **Cache Clearing:** Clearing the Expo and npm caches is crucial.   The commands would vary depending on your system but generally include deleting `node_modules` and using `expo prebuild` and `expo start --clear`. 
3. **Network Check:** Ensure network connectivity is stable.  Proxies or firewalls might interfere with the bundler's ability to download packages.
4. **Native Module Review:** If using native modules, ensure they are correctly installed and configured for your platform and that the necessary native code is appropriately compiled.
5. **System Resources:** Make sure that the system (computer) has enough RAM and processing power.
